	<LinkCard
        title="Protocol"
        description="Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that require a change to Ethereum’s consensus layer (CL) and execution layer (EL). This includes proposals that modify or alter the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), consensus protocol (Proof of Stake & Proof of Work), and Ethereum’s networking stack."

    />
	<LinkCard 
        title="Infrastructure"
        description="Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that touch Ethereum’s infrastructure layer. Mostly around JSON-RPC APIs, wallets, bridges/interoperability protocols, and staking node operators."

    />
	<LinkCard
        title="Applications"
        description="Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that touch Ethereum’s application layer. Often defined as a separate subcategory of EIPs: Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs). Application-layer standards include standards to ensure interoperability between tokens, applications, and general proposals to improve the Ethereum development process."
