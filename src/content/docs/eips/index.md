#### The ultimate resource on EIPs for research nerds.

EIPs Wiki is a minimal extension to the official EIPs website designed to provide a Wikipedia-like experience for readers. Unlike the official [eips.ethereum.org](http://eips.ethereum.org) website, the wiki has a more granular classification of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and clear categorization of EIPs into “topic buckets”.

Want to dive down into the rabbit hole of EVM opcodes? Or explore changes to Ethereum’s resource pricing model over the years? Or maybe you just want to know which NFT standard is useful. You’re in the right place. EIPs Wiki is built with structure in mind: Wikipedia is a great for research nerds because the platform does all the heavy lifting—you can learn about LLMs by meandering through Wikipedia’s (carefully curated) maze of resources without thinking too hard about what to read next.
